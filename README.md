# THE SOURCE CODE HAS MIGRATED TO [CODEBERG](https://codeberg.org/thairanaru/thairanaru-website)

Source code for [thairanaru.netlify.app](thairanaru.netlify.app)

The website is currently only made up with HTML and CSS with a little bit of plain JavaScript. There is probably a whole ton of caveman code here - look, I am not a programmer.\
Because of the preexisting creative common licenses, I don't think I can actually open source the code. However, if you [contact me](https://thairanaru.netlify.app/social-media.html), I would be happy to make an open source MIT template website if you have any interest making a website like this. However, making your own website from scratch is a really fun experience too.
