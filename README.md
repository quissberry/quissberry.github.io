Source code for website

The website is currently only made up with HTML and CSS with a little bit of plain JavaScript. There is probably a whole ton of caveman code here - look, I am not a programmer. Because I am not certain how creative commons interfere with open source licences, assume everything is source available. However, if you [contact me](https://thairanaru.netlify.app/social-media.html), I would be happy to make an open source template website if you have any interest making a website like this. However, making your own website from scratch is a really fun experience too.
