    <p>Ayo! I am Peter, though I go by various internet alias like thairanaru or quissberry. I am a rambling level two writer and procrastinator. I live in Snohomish County, Washington. This website is for my writing projects, random thoughts, or anything I feel worth sharing. My goal is to grow this website gradually into a vibrant gallery in the hope of one day this place becoming one worth visiting. You can support my dream in <a href="https://discord.gg/aFSrGMhxEh">my discord server</a>.</p>
    <p>I am also trying to make this website accessible as possible. The website should generally usable without Javascript as I have focused on making everything work only on HTML or CSS. If you have any problems with accessibility, let me know for sure!</p>
    <p>Also I feel like anyone wandering this website would ask, "what's up with the Chinese/Japanese dates?". Well, I just think they look much cooler than English dates honestly.</p>
