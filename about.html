<h1>About</h1>
<div> 
    <p style="text-align: start;">Ayo! I am quissberry, a rambling level two writer. This website is for my writing projects, random thoughts, or anything I feel worth sharing. My goal is to grow this website gradually into a vibrant gallery in the hope of one day this place becoming one worth visiting. You can support my dream in <a href="https://discord.gg/aFSrGMhxEh">my discord server</a>.</p>
    <p>Also I feel like anyone wondering this website would ask, "what's up with the Chinese/Japanese dates?". Well, I just think they look much cooler than English dates.</p>
