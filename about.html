    <p>Ayo! I am quissberry, a rambling level two writer. This website is for my writing projects, random thoughts, or anything I feel worth sharing. My goal is to grow this website in a vibrant gallery gradually in the hope of one day this place becoming one worth visiting. You can support my mission in <a href="https://discord.gg/aFSrGMhxEh">my discord server</a>.</p>
