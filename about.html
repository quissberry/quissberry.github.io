<h1>About This Website</h1>
<div> 
    <p>Ayo! I am quissberry although you may see me as akanequissberry or nooblivecam in other places. I am a rambling level two writer and procrastinator. I live in Snohomish County, Washington. This website is for my writing projects, random thoughts, or anything I feel worth sharing. My goal is to grow this website gradually into a vibrant gallery in the hope of one day this place becoming one worth visiting. You can support my dream in <a href="https://discord.gg/aFSrGMhxEh">my discord server</a>.</p>
    <p>A secondary goal of mine for this website is make it acessible as possible for all users and devices. If you have any problems concerning this, let me know for sure!</p>
    <p>Also I feel like anyone wandering this website would ask, "what's up with the Chinese/Japanese dates?". Well, I just think they look much cooler than English dates.</p>
