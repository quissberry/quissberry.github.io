<h1>This Music Group Ruined All Other Songs for Me, and I Don’t Mind.</h1>
<div> 
  <p>Two months ago, I would have never imagined myself being addicted to a single music artist. Typically when I discover a new music artist I like, I would just listen their albums but then get bored of their music after a few weeks. Originally, ZUTOMAYO was no exception as I appended their songs to my music list. However, I began to listen to ZUTOMAYO much more again, and then before I knew it, I was addicted. Even though I have listened to their songs so many times, every time I try to not listen to ZUTOMAYO, I often say to myself, “This is nice music. But why listen to this, when I can listen to ZUTOMAYO?”. Then I would return back to listening to ZUTOMAYO. And when I do. I always find something that makes me love their songs even more. ZUTOMAYO is a popular music group in Japan that focuses on J-pop and rock. They founded pretty recently. The reason ZUTOMAYO is so great is because of the variety and the creative song writing in their music in both in the vocals and the instrumental.</p> 
  <p>Note that even though some of the songs names have English names, a few of them only have Japanese names. So for those names, I will use to find a romanization version of the Japanese name.</p>
  <p>First one of the biggest highlights of the group is the phenomenal song accompaniments. These instrumental parts are very well written. For example, at the end of the first chorus in "Inside Joke", there is very flashy solo part for the strings which is filled with string techniques from portamentos to repeated down bow strokes. As a former string player, hearing it all in combination of triplet rhythm, I could do nothing but to always bop my head at that moment.</p>
  <p>This amazing string writing is the across the entire song, not just in this solo.</p>

	<p>In "Kettobashita Moufu", the verses have a unique jazzy bossa nova-like sound that contrasts with the sharp chorus.</p>
