<p>A different way to listen to music have been forgotten: music radio.
Although some of us may might have listen to the radio in the car, in
the digital world, it is easy to get accustomed to listening songs in
demand and making your own music playlists in music platforms like
Spotify and Youtube. There is nothing wrong with that. I have been doing
that for years and still do. However, for the past couple of months, I
have been trying out internet radio too. Despite its limitations,
internet radio provide a viable alternative music listening experience
to modern streaming services.</p>
<h2 id="why-radio">Why Radio?</h2>
<p>Internet radios give a predetermined program of music to listen to.
Although being unable to choose your songs may seem like a flaw at
first, this lack of choice could also be useful.</p>
<p>It can save valuable time spent on choosing songs or making
playlists. In Spotify, I would need manually pick out every song in my
playlist. And even after that, you might need to search for new songs to avoid the playlist getting too repetitive. With internet radio, when I feel like listening to a certain
genre, I will choose a radio that focuses on that genre. Without no human input needed, radio cuts away a lot of inconveniences, making song selection automatic.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because of this, listening to the radio is an effective method to
listen to a range of different music which you have been never exposed to. For example, one of my favorite
radios I discovered is <a href="https://www.slayradio.org/home.php#news">SLAY Radio</a> which focuses on C64 remixes. I do not
know anything about C64 remixes but if I want to listen to it, I do not
need to find C64 artist or search up any songs - I just hop in to SLAY
radio. By using a radio over a streaming service, it entirely wipes out
the process of finding music by yourself.</p>
<h2 id="okay-but-i-can-do-this-too-in-my-streaming-platform">Okay, but I
can do this too in my streaming platform!</h2>
<p>Yes, a lot of streaming services now make auto-generated playlists
which allow you to do the same thing. However, there are certain
advantages you will see only in internet radio.</p>
<p>For starters, it is completely free. With just an URL link, you can
access any radio through the internet. Now the only caveat is that some
radios feature advertisements, which I will discuss later.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are multiple applications or in other words,
clients for internet radio. Because internet radio is based on open
protocols, anyone can make a internet radio client. They are easy to
find one that fits your needs, and if you do not like one, you can
always find another. My preferred client is <a href="https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio">PyRadio</a> which are for geeks
like me that want listen to radio even at the terminal!</p>

<p>Finally, in some countries, you can legally record off from radios
for offline listening. Although there are methods to download music for
free like <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>, radio could be an ethical way to download music. Not a
lot of radio clients can do this, but for the clients that can, it is
awesome. Some clients like <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Shortwave">Shortwave</a> can cut individual songs
automatically which is convenient.</p>

<h2
id="this-all-sounds-wonderful-no-pun-intended-but-there-has-to-be-some-negatives.">What are some of the negatives?</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, some radios have some advertisements. This
is going to vary between radios. There are many great radios that have
no interruptions at all. In some radios like SLAY Radio, there will only
short voice-overs reminding what radio station you are listening to
between songs. Others like Classic FM UK offer insights before each
song. However, some internet radios takes a minute before starting for
product advertisements. There had been times where I felt the advertisements were really annoying, but sometimes it just comes down in finding the best radios to listen to. Ultimately radios are
 free though so it is difficult to complain about the advertisements.</p>
<p>Another thing to be aware of is that you cannot be too picky of what
music you listen to. The truth is that not every song in the radio is good, and I
sometimes switch between radios to just avoid a bad song. Furthermore, you
also might have difficulty finding radios with niche taste. If having
high audio quality is important to you, you will be limited to a smaller
number of radios.</p>
<h2 id="quick-guide">Quick Guide</h2>
<p>There are multiple internet radio clients for desktop and mobile.
<a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/users">Here is a list of some of them</a>, but you can easily search them up too. Many application have builtin radio search which are easy to use.</p>

<p>For applications where you have to manually insert radio stream links, I like to use <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/">radio-browser</a> to find new radio stations. You can search for radios based on country and tags. By personal experience, I recommend sorting by the number of votes rather than clicks.</p>

<p>I hope this encourages you to try internet radio. To be clear, I do
not think internet radio should be a full on replacement to streaming
services. There are clear advantages for both, and I only really listen
to internet radio 20% of the time. Thanks for reading and feel free to
give me any feedback.</p>
