    A different way of listening to music has been forgotten: music radio. Some of us may have listened to radio in the
    car, but modern streaming services like Spotify and YouTube have been growing more popular.
    There is nothing wrong with music on demand. It allows you to listen to your own playlists with your own songs. I
    have been using it for years, and I still use it today. However, I have been trying out internet radio for the past
    couple of months. Despite its limitations, internet radio provide a viable alternative to modern streaming services.
  </p>
  <h2 id="why-radio">Why Radio?</h2>
  <p>Internet radios give a predetermined program of music to listen to.
    Although being unable to choose your songs may seem like a flaw at
    first, this lack of choice could also be useful.</p>
  <p>It can save valuable time spent on choosing songs or making
    playlists. In Spotify, I would need manually pick out every song in my
    playlist. And even after that, you might need to search for new songs to avoid the playlist getting too repetitive.
    With internet radio, when I feel like listening to a certain
    genre, I will choose a radio that focuses on that genre. Without no human input needed, radio cuts away a lot of
    inconveniences, making song selection automatic.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, because of this, listening to the radio is an effective method to
    listen to a range of different music which you have been never exposed to. For example, one of my favorite
    radios I discovered is <a href="https://www.slayradio.org/home.php#news">SLAY Radio</a> which focuses on C64
    remixes. I do not
    know anything about C64 remixes but if I want to listen to it, I do not
    need to find C64 artist or search up any songs - I just hop in to SLAY
    radio. By using a radio over streaming in demand, it becomes easier to focus on listening to music right away.</p>
  <h2 id="okay-but-i-can-do-this-too-in-my-streaming-platform">Okay, but I
    can do this too in my streaming platform!</h2>
  <p>Yes, a lot of streaming services now make auto-generated playlists
    which allow you to do the same thing. However, there are certain
    advantages you will see only in internet radio.</p>
  <p>For starters, it is completely free. With just an URL streaming link, you can
    access any radio through the internet. Now the only caveat is that some
    radios feature advertisements, which I will discuss later.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, there are multiple applications or in other words,
    clients for internet radio. Because internet radio is based on open
    protocols, anyone can make a internet radio client. They are easy to
    find one that fits your needs, and if you do not like one, you can
    always find another. My preferred client is <a href="https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio">PyRadio</a> which are
    for geeks
    like me that want listen to radio even at the terminal!
    This can be a big contrast compared to other streaming platforms which may be non-native to your operation system or
    use more distracting and resource heavy
    features. By having more choice more than one client, you use grants you with ultimiately more personalization for
    your needs.

  <p>Finally, in some countries, you can legally record off from radios
    for offline listening. Although there are methods to download music for
    free like <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>, radio could be an ethical way to download music.
    Not a
    lot of radio clients can do this, but for the clients that can, it is
    awesome. Some clients like <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Shortwave">Shortwave</a> can cut
    individual songs
    automatically which is convenient.</p>

  <h2 id="this-all-sounds-wonderful-no-pun-intended-but-there-has-to-be-some-negatives.">What are some of the negatives?
  </h2>
  <p>Like I mentioned earlier, some radios have some advertisements. This
    is going to vary between radios. There are many great radios that have
    no interruptions at all. In some radios like SLAY Radio, there will only
    short voice-overs reminding what radio station you are listening to
    between songs. Others like Classic FM UK offer insights before each
    song. However, some internet radios takes a minute before starting for
    product advertisements. There had been times where I felt the advertisements were really annoying, but sometimes it
    just comes down in finding the good radios to listen to (which they are many). However, ultimately radios are
    free though so it is difficult to complain about the advertisements.</p>
  <p>Another thing to be aware of is that you cannot be too picky of what
    music you listen to. The truth is that not every song in the radio is good, and I
    sometimes switch between radios to just avoid a bad song. Furthermore, you
    also might have difficulty finding radios with niche taste. If having
    high audio quality is important to you, you will be limited to a smaller
    number of radios.</p>
  <h2 id="quick-guide">Quick Guide</h2>
  <p>One simple option I have seen many people use is <a href="https://radio.garden">Radio Garden</a>. Radio Garden is a
    radio player which you can use on the browser. The cool thing about it is that it enables you to pick radios through
    a
    novel globe interface, allowing you to pick base on geography which is very cool, esspecially if
    you are interested in world music.</p>

    alt='A screenshot of Radio Garden displaying the globe. A ring surrounds a location of a radio station. On the side, it states the name of the station, "ON Heavy Metal".'></img>
  <div class="caption">A screenshot of Radio Garden</div>
  <p>However, if Radio Garden does not fit your needs, there are multiple other internet radio clients for desktop and
    mobile. <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/users">Here is a list of some of them</a>, but you can easily search
    them up
    too. Many application have builtin radio search which are easy to use.
  </p>

  <div class="caption">A screenshot of Shortwave's radio selection page</div>
  <p>For applications where you have to manually insert radio stream links, I use <a
      href="https://www.radio-browser.info/">radio-browser</a> to find new radio stations. You can search for radios
    based on country and tags. By personal experience, I recommend sorting by the number of votes rather than clicks.
  </p>

  <p>I hope this encourages you to try internet radio. To be clear, I do
    not think internet radio should be a full on replacement to streaming
    services. There are clear advantages for both, and I only really listen
    to internet radio 20% of the time when I am in the mood to listen with music with more variety. Thanks for reading
    and feel free to
    give me any feedback.</p>
